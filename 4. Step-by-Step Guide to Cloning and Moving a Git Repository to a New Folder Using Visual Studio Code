Open terminal in vs code 
Give a Command :  "git clone {link}"
Example  : git clone "https://github.com/Kiruba02/GithubNotes.git"

Open terminal and navigate to the created repository using the command:
Command :  cd "{{created repository name In  github}} "
Example : cd "GithubNotes"
Press Enter.
Terminal path will appear as : "C:\Users\ekiruba\Desktop\ExampleGIT\GithubNotes>"
Open File Explorer and navigate to the path: "C:\Users\ekiruba\Desktop\ExampleGIT\GithubNotes"
Click View → enable Show → select Hidden items.
The hidden .git folder becomes visible.

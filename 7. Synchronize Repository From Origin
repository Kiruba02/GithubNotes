## Git Pull – Synchronizing Changes from Origin Repository

### Scenario
A file **dummy.txt** is created directly in the origin repository (GitHub).
The file is not available in the local working folder because the local repository is not yet synchronized with the remote repository.
---
### Step 1: Pull Changes from Origin
Run the following command in the working folder:
```
Command :  git pull
```
**Purpose:**
The `git pull` command downloads the latest changes from the remote repository (origin) and updates the local repository and working folder.
---
### Result
* The newly created file **dummy.txt** becomes available in the working folder.
* The local repository is synchronized with the origin repository.
---
### Scenario – Updating Existing Files
If the content of **test1.txt** is modified in the origin repository, run:
```
Command : git pull
```
**Result:**
* The updated content is fetched from GitHub.
* The same changes are reflected automatically in the working folder.
---
### Technical Explanation
The `git pull` command performs two operations:
1. **Fetch** – Downloads the latest commits from the remote repository.
2. **Merge** – Applies the downloaded changes to the local branch.
---
### Synchronization Flow
```
GitHub (Origin Repository) → Local Git Repository → Working Folder
```
---
### Conclusion
The `git pull` command is used to synchronize the local working environment with the latest updates available in the origin repository.

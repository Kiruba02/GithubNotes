Scenario : 
A file test3.txt is created in the working folder and later deleted using Visual Studio Code.
The file is removed only from the local working directory and still exists in the remote repository (origin – GitHub).

Step 1: Check File Status
After deleting the file in the working folder

Command : git status
Output : Git displays the file as : "deleted: test3.txt"

Step 2: Add the Deletion to the Staging Area
Stage the deletion using:
Command : git add {file name}
Example : git add test3.txt
Purpose:
The add command stages the deletion change and moves it to the Staging Area.

Step 3: Commit the Change
Command : git commi -m {commit message}
Example : git commit -m "test3.txt deleted"
Purpose : The commit command saves the staged deletion into the local Git repository.

Step 4: Push to Remote Repository (Origin)
Push the committed change to GitHub:
Commit : git push origin main
Example : git push origin main
Origin Repository: https://github.com/Kiruba02/GithubNotes.git
Purpose :The push command updates the remote repository and removes the file from GitHub.

Deletion Flow Explanation
File test3.txt is deleted in the working folder.
git add stages the deletion.
git commit records the deletion in the local repository.
git push updates GitHub and removes the file from the remote repository.

Conclusion
Any modification such as file creation, update, or deletion follows the same workflow:
Modification (Insert / Update / Delete) → Add → Commit → Push

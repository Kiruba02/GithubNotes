1. Creating a New File and Checking Status
Create a new file in Visual Studio Code.
Click New File and name the file: "test2.txt"
Open the VS Code terminal and run the command : git status
Output shows the file as an untracked file.
This indicates a newly created file that is not yet added to Git tracking.

2. Previous Setup Explanation

Flow 1: GitHub (Test1.txt) → Git Copy Folder → Working Folder

Origin Repository : https://github.com/Kiruba02/GithubNotes.git
The origin repository contains an existing file.
Repository is copied to the local machine using the clone command.
Command : git clone {origin}
Reason for cloning: Cloning creates a local copy of the remote GitHub repository for development and modification.

3. Flow 1 Explanation : 
The clone operation creates a connection between GitHub and the Git Copy Folder.
The Working Folder contains test2.txt as an untracked file.
GitHub contains Test1.txt.
After cloning, the Git Copy Folder contains Test1.txt, which is copied from the GitHub repository.

4. Local Machine Structure
Local machine contains a Git Copy Folder and a Working Folder.
A new file (test2.txt) is created inside the Working Folder (Visual Studio Code).
After file creation, running git status shows the file as an untracked file because Git has not started tracking the file yet.

5. Next Step
Use the following command in the VS Code terminal:
Command : git add {file name}
Example : git add test2.txt
Note : The add operation creates a connection between the Working Folder and the Staging Area.

6. Flow 2
GitHub (Test1.txt) → Git Copy Folder → Working Folder → Staging Area

7. What is the Staging Area?
Check the status using : git status
The output shows “changes to be committed.”
This state is called the Staging Area, where selected changes are prepared before committing.

8. Commit Operation
At this stage, the origin repository does not contain test2.txt.
Use the commit command : git commit -m "test2.txt added"

9. Flow Explanation:
Using the add command changes the file state from untracked to staged (moves from Working Folder to Staging Area).
Using the commit command moves the changes from the Staging Area to the Git Copy Folder (local repository).
Using the push command transfers changes from the Git Copy Folder to GitHub.

10. Push Changes to Origin
To display test2.txt in the origin repository, use:
Command : git push origin main
This command uploads committed changes to the GitHub repository.
